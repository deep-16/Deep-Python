#LESSER OF TWO EVENS: Write a function that returns the lesser of two given numbers if both numbers are even, but returns the greater if one or both numbers are odd

def guess_number(a,b):
    for num in a,b:
        if a%2 == 0 and b%2 == 0:
        #BOTH ARE EVEN
            return min(a,b)
        else:
        #EITHER ONE OR BOTH ARE ODD
            return max(a,b)
